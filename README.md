Welcome to my solutions for the puzzles of Advent of Code![^aoc]  
This repository is made using the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains.

[^aoc]:
[Advent of Code][aoc] – An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
